# Dialogue Experiment

The Project was an experiment to discover a method for a Dialogue System. 

The Player approaches the NPC, Presses the 'F' key to interact with them and then read and respond to the NPC's Dialogue.

I looked into using a Blackboard and Behaviour Tree, two systems built into Unreal Engine.
These tools allow me to create a Dialogue System that changes based on the player's choice with minimal coding or Blueprint.

The aim of this project was to find a way to create a modular Dialogue system that could be easily modified and expanded later if needed.
